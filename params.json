It also provides functions that improvise the behaviour of system commands and automate routine tasks.\r\n\r\n## USAGE\r\nSimply place it your home directory (`~/.bash`) (or any other directory of your choice) and add this line to your bashrc:\r\n`source [INSTALL_LOCATION]/.bash/init.sh`\r\n\r\n\r\n## CODE CONVENTIONS\r\nFollowing code conventions are followed in scripts to make them more understandable.\r\n- No hardcoded values or paths. Define constants at the top of the file in ALL_CAPS.\r\n- Do not directly use $1, $2. Assign these to meaningful variables inside the function before using it. \r\n- As a general rule all usages of variables should be quoted. There should never be $1 $2 in a script. This would save a lot of effort in dealing with bugs that arise from not quoting string variables.\r\n- Use asserts to check number of input parameters.\r\n- Every function should have a comment on top with these three lines:\r\nDescription\r\nUsage: \r\nExample:\r\n- All functions should echo the command that they ultimately construct and use. This will aid in learning the real commands.\r\n- The echo from functions is colored for better readability:\r\nBLACK output from system commands\r\nBLUE info messages, what the function is trying to do\r\nRED error messages, what the function couldn't do\r\n- When system commands are improvised and replaced the original versions are made available via syntax _commandname. This would cause any third party scripts that rely on these programs to fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n## NOTES\r\n- Files that are dependant on other file and must be sourced in an order must be prefixed with a number. Example: 01_var.sh, 02_path.sh\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
